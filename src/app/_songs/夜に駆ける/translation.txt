I feel like it's sinking, like it's melting
On this night, upon which a sky just for the two of us expands

All you said was "goodbye"
From that single word, I understood everything that was going on
On the other side of the fence, I saw you
And the sky with the setting sun overlap
Since the day we first met
You'd stolen my whole heart
You, who were clad in a kinda fleeting aura,
Wore such lonely eyes

In this world that keeps on clacking 'tick-tock'
Time and time again,
Tears may be about to fall
From the heartless words and picky voices I come into contact with,
But I'm sure that if we're together, we'll be able to find a commonplace happiness

This is for you, who've become unable to smile in these turbulent days--
Please have the brightest morning I can think up
Before you fall into an unbreaking night,
Go on-- take hold of my hand
Even the days in which you'd sealed yourself away, wanting to forget--
I'll melt them away with the warmth of my embrace
So there's nothing to be scared of
Let's stay together till the sun eventually rises

I hate it when you're gazing at something
That only you can see
That face, that's as if you're captivated, as if you're in love
Is something I really hate

Things that you want to believe, yet cannot believe--
Like it or not, stuff like that's always
Gonna happen many times from now on
And each time we're gonna get angry and cry
But even so, surely, one day surely, we surely
Will be able to understand one another; I believe

"Ah, I've had enough, I'm sick and tired of it"
You say, brushing away the hand I'm desperately stretching outwards to you
"I've had enough; I'm sick and tired of it", huh
Truth is, I wanna say the same thing

Hey, look; in this world that is clacking 'tick-tock' again,
Time and time again,
None of the words I've prepared for you are reaching you
"I just want to bring it to an end"
The moment your attitude leads me to say these words,
You smiled for the first time

I'd become unable to smile in these turbulent days
And to my eyes, you're ever so pretty
Even the tears I spilt on unbreaking nights
Are getting melted away by your smile
I'd been crying in these unchanging days
And you gently invited me to the end
Like it's sinking, like it's melting
The fog that had taken hold is cleared away
In these days in which I had sealed myself away, wanting to forget
I take your hand that you held out to me
A cool breeze is currently blowing through, as if swimming through the sky

Don't release our held hands
We now set off running into the night, together
